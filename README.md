# HBTMSlides
Powerpoint slides for the Hair Brain Tortoise Mind Group Presentation

Please feel free to add or edit any of the slide files you'd like, just make sure to document any file changes with the gitcommit, just in case anyone who changes anything accidentally breaks the program. WHen you edit the file, make sure you do so on a feature or hotfix branch so that we don't break the master copy unnecissarily.

On the other hand, if you guys think that we should leave each other's files alone, and not be able to edit others' work, thats cool too, we can discuss that.
